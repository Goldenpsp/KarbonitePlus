=============

Karbonite Plus (K+) - New resources and parts for Karbonite

K+ adds new resource and gameplay elements as well as supporting parts to Karbonite. K+ requires Karbonite (not included) to use.

Enhancements and Changes included in K+

New resource: 
Karborundum. Valuable and incredibly fuel efficient, but also very hard to get. It can be harvested on the surfaces of Eeloo and Eve, or by a solar collector within approximately 2000 meters of the sun's surface. Hats off to nli2work for his awesome rover-sized models, and for TMarkos for being awesome and collaborative!

New parts:
- Tiny radial Karbonite/Karborundum drill.  0.625m form factor, can be node or surface attached.  Also KAS-portable!
- Deployable Karborundum scanner (NOTE: Karborundum is only detectable on the surface, or at altitudes lower than approximately 500m over the terrain - so bring your Rovers and nape of the earth (NOE) flyers).
- New fuel tank - the Karry Kan - great for small quantities of Karbonite or LFO. Comes in two sizes - a surface-mountable single Kan, and a double-Kan (great for the Packrat Rover).
- Rover-sized generator, for powering your Karborundum operations on the fly.  KASable, surface and stack attachable.
- New radial tanks to store Karborundum in three sizes - a Jumbo radial tank, an inline tank cluster, as well as a 0.625m mini tank.  The mini tank is KAS-enabled.
- A Karborundum sample tank. Luxuriantly expensive, but saves you the trip to eeloo. Made for testing purposes. Warning: Will self-decouple and explode when empty!  Hilarity may ensue.
- A new particle collector with slightly better range (at the cost of efficiency and energy use), allowing it to skim the sun's surface picking up stray Karborundum particles.
- The Karborundum Fusion Drive (in two sizes - 1.25m and 2.5m) Expensive, incredibly efficient, but require significant EC to operate, and runs on Karborundum.
- A small but adorable 0.625m Karbonite engine.  This one has the added benefit of taking some of the vented exhaust and converting it into monopropellant for later use.

Dev Note: The Karborundum engines are absolutely OP compared to stock engines (we're in KSPI territory with these), This is to balance the absurd difficulty in getting fuel for them. Tech tree wise, Karborundum-specific parts will be under Nuclear Propulsion. Karbonite bits will be under Fuel Systems.
